I enjoy playing it with my friends or people I meet during pickup. The only thing that I don't like about basketball compared to soccer or other sports, is that nobody in my family plays basketball, so it makes it boring sometimes to not be able to talk about it or play it with them. </p>

                <p class="card-text">I weightlift in my free time. I started weightlifting when I was 10-11 years old. I was working out with my brother and with other family members. My parents encouraged me to keep weightlifting, and I still do to this day. I enjoy it since it provides a challenge to me and I can see myself grow. It's really motivating and helpful sometimes too.</p>

                    <p class="card-text"> I played soccer growing up with my brother. It was the main sport my family played, so it was very fun to play with them.  It was the main sport I played until I started playing a variety of other sports. I eventually got to basketball, which I consider to be my favorite sport to play. I rarely play soccer now, but I still know much of the game. </p>

I play video games, browse the internet, or do a variety of other stuff. I am fortunate to have gotten a PC recently, so my computer can run a lot of things. I have used computers from a really young age, so it means a lot to me.  </p>
